# PHPVector Benchmark

A [VectorDBBench](https://github.com/zilliztech/VectorDBBench)-style benchmark for
PHPVector, measuring the four metrics that matter in production:

| Metric | What it tells you |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Index build throughput** | How fast documents can be ingested (doc/s) |
| **Serial QPS** | Sustainable single-process query rate |
| **P99 latency** | Worst-case latency for 99% of queries |
| **Recall@k** | Fraction of true nearest neighbours returned |

A **persistence section** is also included, measuring `save()` and `open()` speed and folder throughput.

---

## Requirements

- **PHP 8.1+** (tested on 8.5)
- **Composer** dependencies installed (`composer install`)
- **Memory:** the script sets `memory_limit = 2G`; override with
  `-d memory_limit=4G` if needed for the `large` scenario
- No external PHP extensions required beyond a standard CLI build

---

## Quick start

```bash
# Default run: XS (1 K) and Small (10 K) scenarios, printed to stdout
php benchmark/benchmark.php

# Save the report to a file
php benchmark/benchmark.php --output=report.md

# Smoke-test only (fastest)
php benchmark/benchmark.php --scenarios=xs

# Full suite
php benchmark/benchmark.php --scenarios=xs,small,medium,large,highdim --output=report.md
```

Progress messages are written to **stderr**; the Markdown report goes to **stdout**
(or the file specified by `--output`). This means piping works cleanly:

```bash
php benchmark/benchmark.php 2>/dev/null > report.md
```

---

## Scenarios

Each scenario generates a fully reproducible synthetic dataset of random
unit-normalised vectors using a fixed seed. The dimensionalities mirror the
ranges used by VectorDBBench (SIFT at 128d, Cohere-style embeddings at 768d).

| Key | Vectors | Dims | Label | Est. RAM | Notes |
|-----|---------|------|-------|----------|-------|
| `xs` | 1,000 | 128 | XS | ~10 MB | Quick smoke test |
| `small` | 10,000 | 128 | S | ~50 MB | SIFT-small scale |
| `medium` | 50,000 | 128 | M | ~250 MB | SIFT-medium scale |
| `large` | 100,000 | 128 | L | ~500 MB | Requires ≥ 512 MB RAM |
| `highdim` | 10,000 | 768 | HD | ~80 MB | Text-embedding scale |

> **Runtime note.** PHPVector is a pure-PHP library; build times are proportional
> to `N × efConstruction`. With the defaults (M=16, efConstruction=200) expect
> several minutes for `medium` and `large`. Use `--ef-construction=50` for faster
> exploratory runs, then benchmark at full quality separately.

The default when no `--scenarios` flag is given is **`xs,small`**.

## HNSW parameter guide

The three HNSW parameters directly control the recall/throughput tradeoff.
Understanding them helps you benchmark what actually matters for your workload.

### `--m` — graph connectivity

`M` is the maximum number of bi-directional edges each node can have per layer
(layer 0 uses `2×M`). Higher values produce a denser, better-connected graph.

| M | Effect |
|---|--------|
| 8 | Lower memory, faster builds, slightly lower recall |
| **16** | **Recommended default — good balance** |
| 32 | Higher recall, ~2× memory, slower inserts |
| 64 | Near-perfect recall for clustered data, very high memory |

### `--ef-construction` — build quality

Controls how thoroughly the algorithm searches for neighbours during insertion.
Higher values improve graph quality and recall, at the cost of longer build time.
Must be ≥ M (enforced automatically).

| efConstruction | Effect |
|----------------|--------|
| 50 | Fast builds; acceptable for exploratory benchmarking |
| **200** | **Default — production-quality graph** |
| 400 | Diminishing returns; only useful for very high-recall targets |

### `--ef-search` — query-time recall vs. speed

Controls how many candidates are explored during a query. This is the primary
query-time knob: increase it to trade speed for recall.

| efSearch | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| 10 | Maximum speed; recall may drop below 90% |
| **50** | **Default — good recall with reasonable latency** |
| 100 | Near-exhaustive; approach 99%+ recall |
| 200 | Effectively exact for most datasets |

> **Tip:** To understand the recall/latency tradeoff for your data, run the
> benchmark twice with `--ef-search=20` and `--ef-search=100` and compare the
> Recall@k and P99 columns in the report.

## Metrics explained

### Index build throughput (doc/s)

Total documents inserted divided by wall-clock time. Captures the full
`addDocument()` cost: random-level sampling, graph insertion, and neighbour
selection. Scales sub-linearly with N (each insert searches an increasingly
large graph).

### Serial QPS

Total queries divided by total search wall-clock time, measured after a 20-query
warmup. "Serial" means queries are issued one at a time from a single process —
this matches the most common PHP deployment pattern (FPM workers, CLI scripts)
and avoids measuring concurrency overhead that PHP cannot express.

### P99 latency

The 99th-percentile search latency computed with linear interpolation over all
query timings. This tells you what the slowest 1 in 100 queries looks like —
the number that actually affects user experience in production. The report also
includes min, mean, P50, and P95 for a full latency distribution picture.

Timings use PHP's `hrtime(true)` (nanosecond monotonic clock) to avoid
wall-clock noise.

### Recall@k

```
Recall@k = |HNSW top-k ∩ BruteForce top-k| / k
```

Averaged over `--recall-samples` queries and reported for k=1, k=5, and k=K
(your configured `--k`). The brute-force ground truth uses exact cosine
similarity computed in `BruteForce.php`.

A Recall@10 of 95% means HNSW returns 9–10 of the true 10 nearest neighbours
on average. Values below ~80% suggest `efSearch` is too low for the dataset, or
`M`/`efConstruction` need increasing.

### Persistence (save / open)

Wall-clock time and throughput (MB/s) for `VectorDatabase::save()` and
`VectorDatabase::open()`. `save()` waits for any outstanding async document
writes, then flushes `hnsw.bin` and `bm25.bin`. `open()` reads only those two
index files; individual document files (`docs/{n}.bin`) are loaded lazily after
search, so open time is typically fast regardless of document count.

---

## Methodology

The benchmark follows VectorDBBench's core principles:

1. **Reproducible data.** All vectors are generated deterministically from
   `--seed`. The same seed always produces the same dataset, making runs
   comparable across machines and PHP versions.

2. **Disjoint query set.** Query vectors are generated from the same seed
   sequence but are *not* inserted into the index, so there are no trivially
   exact matches.

3. **Warmup before measurement.** 20 queries are issued before latency
   measurement begins to eliminate cold-start effects (opcode cache, CPU branch
   predictor).

4. **Serial throughput, not burst.** QPS is measured over the full `--queries`
   run, not a short peak window. This reflects sustained throughput rather than
   best-case behaviour.

5. **Tail latency focus.** P99 is highlighted in the summary table because
   average latency masks outliers that real users experience.

6. **Exact recall ground truth.** `BruteForce.php` computes cosine similarity
   exhaustively over all N vectors for each recall query — the same distance
   metric and ranking order as the HNSW index. There is no approximation in the
   ground truth.

## Recipes

### Fastest possible run (smoke test)

```bash
php benchmark/benchmark.php --scenarios=xs --queries=50 --recall-samples=10
```

### Compare two efSearch values

```bash
php benchmark/benchmark.php --scenarios=small --ef-search=20  --output=report-ef20.md
php benchmark/benchmark.php --scenarios=small --ef-search=100 --output=report-ef100.md
```

Diff the two files to see the recall vs. latency tradeoff.

### High-recall configuration

```bash
php benchmark/benchmark.php \
  --scenarios=small,medium \
  --m=32 \
  --ef-construction=400 \
  --ef-search=100 \
  --output=report-highrecall.md
```

### Large dataset without recall (brute-force would be slow)

```bash
php -d memory_limit=1G benchmark/benchmark.php \
  --scenarios=large \
  --no-recall \
  --queries=500 \
  --output=report-large.md
```

### Persistence-only benchmark (skip search and recall)

```bash
php benchmark/benchmark.php \
  --scenarios=small,medium \
  --no-recall \
  --queries=1 \
  --output=report-persist.md
```

### Reproducible CI run

```bash
php benchmark/benchmark.php \
  --scenarios=xs,small \
  --seed=42 \
  --queries=200 \
  --recall-samples=50 \
  --output=benchmark-results.md
```

Using a fixed `--seed` guarantees identical datasets across runs, making it safe
to diff reports committed to version control.

## Reading the report

The generated Markdown has two sections: a **summary table** and **per-scenario
detail**.

### Summary table

```
| Scenario | Vectors | Dims | Build time | Insert/s | QPS | P99 ms | Recall@10 |
```

- **Build time** — wall-clock duration of the full index build
- **Insert/s** — average document ingestion rate
- **QPS** — serial queries per second (search only, after warmup)
- **P99 ms** — 99th-percentile query latency in milliseconds
- **Recall@10** — fraction of true top-10 results returned on average

### Per-scenario sections

Each scenario expands into four subsections:

**Index build** — vectors inserted, build time, throughput, process RSS after build.

**Search latency** — full latency distribution: min, mean, P50, P95, P99, max.
The spread between P50 and P99 indicates how consistent query times are. A large
gap (e.g. P50=2ms, P99=20ms) suggests HNSW is occasionally traversing many more
nodes for some queries.

**Recall** — breakdown at k=1, k=5, and k=K. Recall@1 is always ≥ Recall@k
because finding the single nearest neighbour is easier than finding the top-K.

**Persistence** — total folder size on disk, time and throughput for `save()` and
`open()`. Useful for planning deployment workflows where the index is built once
and served from disk on each restart. `open()` time is typically much faster than
`save()` because document files are not read eagerly.

## Interpreting results

### Good vs. concerning numbers

| Metric | Healthy | Worth investigating |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| Recall@10 | ≥ 95% | < 85% — increase `efSearch` or `M` |
| P99 / P50 ratio | < 3× | > 5× — graph may have poor connectivity |
| Build throughput | Consistent with N·log(N) growth | Sudden drops may indicate GC pressure |
| save() throughput | > 50 MB/s | Lower suggests filesystem bottleneck |

### The recall/speed tradeoff

HNSW is an *approximate* algorithm. Every parameter change that improves recall
also increases latency, and vice versa. The typical workflow is:

1. Run with default parameters to establish a baseline.
2. Identify whether recall or latency is the bottleneck.
3. If recall is low: increase `--ef-search` first (cheapest), then `--m`.
4. If latency is high: decrease `--ef-search`; consider smaller `--m` if memory
   is also a concern.

### PHP-specific context

PHPVector is a pure-PHP implementation. QPS and build throughput will be
significantly lower than compiled systems (Qdrant, Weaviate, FAISS). The
benchmark makes this explicit: its purpose is to characterise *this library's*
performance envelope, not to compare against other runtimes.

Recall@k and the recall/latency tradeoff curve, however, are algorithm properties
independent of language — they should match reference HNSW implementations given
the same M and efSearch values.
